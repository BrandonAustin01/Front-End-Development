• The <i> and <b> elements are considered deprecated because HTML should not be
used for styling. That’s the role of CSS.

• Headings are represented using <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>. Every
web page should have one and only one <h1> element. Headings should have a natural
hierarchy and should not be skipped.

• Entities are used to display special characters such as angle brackets, copyright symbol,
etc. The most important entities are: &nbsp; (non-breaking space), &lt; (less than
sign), &gt; (greater than sign) and &copy; (copyright symbol).

• The <a> (anchor) element, with its href attribute, is used to create a hyperlink to web
pages, locations in the same page, files and email addresses.

• A relative URL specifies the target resource relative to the current resource. An absolute
URL specifies the location of a resource irrespective of the current resource. It can start
with a / to indicate the root of the website or a protocol (eg http://) to represent a
resource on a different website.

• The <img> element is used to display an image. It’s a common best practice to set the
alt (alternative text) attribute. This helps visually impaired people understand the page
content. Also, if the image cannot be loaded, the alternative text is displayed.

• The <video> and <audio> elements are used to display video and audio. These
elements have boolean attributes such as controls, autoplay and loop.

• The <ul> element is used to represent a list where the order of items doesn’t matter. The
<ol> element is used to represent an ordered list of items. The <dl> (description list)
element is used to implement a glossary or to display metadata.

• The <table> element should only be used to represent tabular data. A table can have
zero or more <tr> (table row) elements. Each <tr> element can have zero or more cells.
Cells can be data cells (<td>) or header cells (<th>).





• The <div> and <span> elements are generic containers used for styling purposes. 
Divs are block-level elements, spans are inline elements. 
A block-level element starts on a new line and takes up the entire available horizontal space.

• Semantic elements help us write markup that is more meaningful and descriptive to search engines, screen readers and other software.
So, use <div> and <span> elements when no other semantic element is appropriate.

• The semantic elements in HTML5 are: <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <main>,
<aside>, <article>, <section>, <figure>, <time> and <mark>.
